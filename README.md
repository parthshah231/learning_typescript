## Learning TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means it has all the features of JavaScript and more. One of the main differences is that TypeScript is strongly typed, meaning it provides additional checks and rules to ensure more robust and error-free code. When you write code in TypeScript, it needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can be run. The TypeScript compiler translates your TypeScript code into JavaScript code that can be understood and executed by browsers or other JavaScript environments.

### Functions

In programming, a function or subroutine is a sequence of instructions that perform a specific task. Think of it as a reusable set of instructions that you can use in your programs whenever you need to do a particular task.

There are different types of functions:
- **Named functions**: These are functions that have a specific name and can be referred to by that name in your code.
- **Anonymous functions (Arrow functions)**: These are functions without a name, often used as callbacks or for shorter code snippets. They are defined using the arrow syntax (`() => {}`).
- **Function expressions**: These are functions that are assigned to a variable or used as values in expressions.
- **Generic functions**: These are functions that can work with different types of data, providing flexibility and reusability.

Functions can have different ways of accepting parameters (inputs):
- **Fixed parameters**: These are parameters that a function expects to receive in a specific order, and they are required.
- **Optional parameters**: These are parameters that can be omitted when calling a function. They have default values or are marked as optional using a `?` symbol.
- **Rest parameters**: These are used when you want to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a function. The rest parameters are represented by `...` followed by the parameter name.

### Classes

Classes are blueprints for creating objects in TypeScript. They help define the structure and behavior of an object.

#### Components of a Class

- **Class variables**: Variables that hold data associated with the class. They can have different access modifiers:
   - **private**: Only accessible within the class.
   - **protected**: Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
   - **public**: Accessible from anywhere.

- **Class methods**: Functions defined within a class that perform specific actions or provide functionality.

#### What You Can Do with Classes

- **Abstraction**: Define abstract concepts or entities that hide implementation details.
- **Inheritance**: Create subclasses (derived classes) based on existing classes (superclasses or base classes) to inherit their properties and methods.
- **Composition**: Build complex classes by combining smaller classes or components.
- **Encapsulation**: Bundle data (properties) and operations (methods) together within a class and control their access.
- **Polymorphism**: Allow objects to take on different forms or exhibit different behaviors based on context.
- **Interfaces**: Define contracts or blueprints for objects, specifying required properties and methods.
- **Modules/Namespaces**: Organize and encapsulate related code into separate files or logical units.
